  ### *Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server used primarily for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). It automates various stages of software development, such as building, testing, and deploying applications, allowing teams to deliver software faster and with higher quality.*

  ## Key Features of Jenkins:


  **Extensibility**: Jenkins supports thousands of plugins, enabling integration with a wide range of tools for version control, build automation, testing, and deployment.

  **Cross-Platform:** It can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

  **Distributed Builds:** Jenkins supports distributed builds, allowing tasks to run on multiple machines to speed up the development process.

  **Pipeline as Code:** Jenkins pipelines can be written as code (using Groovy-based scripts), making it easy to define, version, and share CI/CD workflows.

  **Web Interface**: Jenkins provides an easy-to-use web interface for managing jobs, configurations, and monitoring build statuses.
